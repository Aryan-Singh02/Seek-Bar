Certainly! It sounds like you're working on an Android project that involves a SeekBar to capture user input within the range of 0 to 10. Based on the selected value on the SeekBar, you want to display a corresponding rating with different colors:

If the SeekBar value is between 0 and 3 (inclusive), display the rating text in red.
If the SeekBar value is between 4 and 7 (inclusive), display the rating text in yellow.
If the SeekBar value is between 8 and 10 (inclusive), display the rating text in green.
